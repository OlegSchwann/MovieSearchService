# Movie search service
Laboratory work of the first year of the master's program at the Bauman Moscow State Technical University.
On the subject of distributed databases we needed to make a search service for TV series and movies on mongoDB.
The user interface could be made on any technology, I chose Vue.js without additional libraries.
The backend is written in Golang.
